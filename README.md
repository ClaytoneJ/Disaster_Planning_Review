# Disaster_Planning_Review
For this project I reviewed a fake companies Business Impact Analysis and Disaster Preparedness Plan. After reviewing these documents I created an After Action report based on the outcomes of a fake disaster scenario. This report would help the fake company identify what could be improved in their disaster planning.

### Overview of files:
After_Action_Report: Report I made that provides a comprehensive review and analysis of the response and recovery efforts following the fake disaster.  
Business_Impact_Analysis: business impact analysis done by fake company(they never fully completed it)
Disaster_Preparedness_Plan: Disaster Preparedness plan created by fake company.
LPHG_Disaster_Recovery_Scenario: Overview of fake disaster scenario that happened to the company.
